I am a member of the <a href='https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/en/probability-statistics-and-ergodic-theory'> ergodic theory team</a> at the <a href='https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/en'> IRMAR </a>.

I work in the area of smooth dynamical systems, using techniques from ergodic theory and homogeneous dynamics. Lately, I have been particularly interested in the behavior of the horocycle flow on the moduli space of abelian differentials and related dynamical systems, such as the horospherical foliation in invariant subvarieties of the moduli spaces. I am also interested various applications to counting problems on abelian differentials. During my PhD, I studied the behavior of the isoperiodic foliation and applications to the classification of invariant subvarieties.

I organize the ergodic theory seminar that we hold every monday at 1:45pm at the IRMAR. If you want to come speak, do contact me !

I also co-organize a weekly learning seminar at the IRMAR with my colleague Florestan Martin-Baillon on rigidity phenomena in homogeneous dynamics.
